# Callable_cpp
A c++ Callabe&lt;return_type, args...> concept. It's 40 lines of the most gut-wrenchingly terse template metaprogramming you could imagine. I'm putting this out there hoping to spare someone a few hours of intense pain. Works with function pointers/references, lambdas, std::bind, functors...
